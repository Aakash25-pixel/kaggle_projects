## Customer Churn Classification using Logistic Regression

### 📌 Project Overview
In this project, I worked on predicting customer churn for a telecom company using the **Telco Customer Churn** dataset.  
The goal was to understand **why customers leave** and build a machine learning model that can help businesses take **data-driven retention decisions**.

---

### 📊 Dataset Description
- Source: Kaggle – Telco Customer Churn
- The dataset contains customer information such as:
  - Demographics (gender, senior citizen status)
  - Services subscribed (internet, phone, security, streaming)
  - Account details (tenure, payment method, monthly & total charges)
- Target variable: **Churn** (Yes / No)

---

### 🔧 Approach & Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing and inconsistent values
   - Converted categorical features into numerical format using encoding techniques

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed churn distribution across different customer segments
   - Visualized relationships between tenure, charges, and churn behavior
   - Identified key factors influencing customer churn

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Encoded categorical variables
   - Scaled numerical features where required
   - Prepared data for model training

4. **Model Building**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets
   - Trained a **Logistic Regression** model
   - Evaluated performance using accuracy and classification metrics

---

### 📈 Results & Insights
- The Logistic Regression model was able to predict churn with reasonable accuracy
- Customers with **short tenure**, **higher monthly charges**, and **lack of bundled services** showed higher churn probability
- The model provides interpretable results that can help businesses identify at-risk customers early

### 🧠 Skills & Tools Used
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn  
- **Concepts:** EDA, Feature Engineering, Logistic Regression, Model Evaluation

### 📌 Key Takeaway
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of **end-to-end data analysis**, from raw data exploration to building and evaluating a machine learning model, while keeping the business problem at the center of the solution.
